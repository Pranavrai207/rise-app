Concept: A habit-tracking app that gamifies self-improvement through an unconventional RPG progression system.

Core Features & UX
Metaphysical Progression: Replaces standard RPG tropes with unique stats. Meditation/focus tasks align Chakras, while physical habits build Vitality.

Habit Dashboard: Clean UI for managing daily tasks, recurring habits, and one-off milestones.

Dynamic Avatar: A visual representation of progress that reflects the user's "Aura" based on consistency and task completion.

Technical Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Cross-platform iOS/Android).

Backend: Python with FastAPI (Managing RPG logic and AI integrations).

Database: PostgreSQL (Relational storage for user stats, quests, and auth).
